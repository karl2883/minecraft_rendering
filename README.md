# minecraft_rendering
I'm just trying to learn opengl and improve my c++ skills

## To run:
0. Be on a unix system
1. Clone the repository
2. Make a "build" folder
3. Go into that folder
4. Run "cmake .."
5. Run "cmake --build ."
6. Go back to the project directory
7. Run "./build/src/Main"

You will see a grass pyramid, you can float with standard minecraft controls. L/F to activate wireframe (line) or fill mode.
